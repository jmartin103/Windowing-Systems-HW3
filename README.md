# Windowing-Systems-HW3
A window containing three slider bars, two combo boxes, a progress bar, and a text field. The left combo box contains the values of the three sliders, and when one of these sliders is selected, the selected slider becomes enabled, while the other two remain disabled. The right combo box allows the user to enable either the progress bar or the text field at the bottom of the window. If progress bar is selected, the progress bar is enabled while the text field remains disabled. Depending on which of these two is selected, the enabled field will increase with the enabled slider's value. If the text field is selected, the value of the slider will show in the text field.
